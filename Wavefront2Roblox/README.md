About the project
=================
This is a converter that I wrote a while ago. This converter converts Wavefront (.obj) meshes to ROBLOX parts. This converter in particular does it relatively fast.

This project is final, meaning that I will not provide updates or maintain to the source.

Usage
-----
Once compiled, using the converter is relatively simple. Select your input file and an output file, hit convert and you're almost there. In ROBLOX studio find the 'Execute Script' option and select the output file generated by the converter. Now you'll only have to wait a short while before your mesh is imported!
